- stoical, proof-of-concept ELF crypter
    Name taken from wiktionary's word of the day archive.
    Created for educational purposes, not obligatory to be continued.

- description
    Rewrites entry point to loaded decrpying stub, crypts your code.
    Code resides in the end of .text, so some code could get corrupted.
    It has one single and simple unittest.

- requirements
    gcc, linux(shouldn't be too unportable), ruby

- issues
    Many things actually use the code in the end of .text, those
    things will raise a segfault when ran.

- usage
    ./main <elf>

- example
    % make
    % cp /bin/zsh .
    % ./main zsh
    % echo "echo $(( 9 * 9 ))" | ./zsh 
    81
    % md5sum /bin/zsh zsh
